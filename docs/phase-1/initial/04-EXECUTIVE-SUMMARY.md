# Executive Summary: MeTTaIL Rust Migration

**Date:** 2025-10-25  
**Status:** Planning Complete, Ready for Implementation  
**Decision Required:** Approve POC approach

---

## What We're Doing

Migrating **MeTTaIL** (Meta Type Talk Intermediate Language) from Scala+BNFC to Rust, exploring procedural macros as the implementation approach.

## Why

### Current Problems
1. **Language barrier:** MeTTaIL in Scala, Rholang in Rust ‚Üí FFI overhead
2. **Runtime validation:** Errors caught late, not at compile time
3. **Limited type safety:** Categories are strings, not types
4. **Network transmission unclear:** No clean path for f1r3fly

### Benefits of Rust Implementation
1. **Native integration:** No FFI, direct use in rholang/
2. **Compile-time validation:** Invalid theories won't compile
3. **Type safety:** Categories become Rust types
4. **Performance:** Zero-cost abstractions
5. **Network-ready:** Clear serialization path for f1r3fly

---

## Three Approaches Evaluated

### 1. Procedural Macros (Innovative)
```rust
theory! {
    name: Rholang,
    // ... generates AST, parser, interpreter at compile-time
}
```
- ‚úÖ Best type safety & performance
- ‚ùå Most complex to implement
- ‚è±Ô∏è 2-3 months for full features

### 2. LALRPOP + Runtime (Pragmatic)
```rust
let theory = parse_module("Rholang.module")?;
theory.interpret(&mut space, ast);
```
- ‚úÖ Balanced complexity & features
- ‚úÖ Dynamic loading easy
- ‚è±Ô∏è 6-8 weeks for full features

### 3. Direct Port from Scala (Conservative)
```rust
let pipeline = Pipeline::new(/* same as Scala */);
pipeline.execute(context)?;
```
- ‚úÖ Lowest risk, fastest
- ‚ùå Doesn't leverage Rust strengths
- ‚è±Ô∏è 3-4 weeks for port

---

## Recommendation: Hybrid Approach

**Start with runtime, add macros for optimization.**

### Phase 1: Runtime Foundation (Month 1)
Port core Scala implementation to Rust:
- Parse `.module` files
- Validate theories
- Interpret compositions
- **Deliverable:** Working MeTTaIL in Rust

### Phase 2: Network Integration (Month 2)
Enable f1r3fly transmission:
- Serialization protocol
- Dynamic theory loading
- Security validation
- **Deliverable:** Language-as-data over network

### Phase 3: Macro POC (Parallel to Month 1-2)
Validate procedural macro feasibility:
- Build minimal `theory! {}` macro
- Generate AST types
- Compile-time validation
- **Deliverable:** Decision point - proceed with macros?

### Phase 4: Optimization (Month 3+, if macros viable)
Add compile-time path for static theories:
- Expand macro features
- Migrate Rholang definition to macros
- Keep runtime for dynamic theories
- **Deliverable:** Hybrid system

---

## Minimal POC (This Week)

**Goal:** Prove macro feasibility in 11-14 hours

**Scope:**
```rust
theory! {
    name: SimpleMonoid,
    exports { Elem; },
    terms {
        Zero . Elem ::= "0" ;
        Plus . Elem ::= Elem "+" Elem ;
    }
}
```

**Proves:**
1. Can parse `theory! {}` syntax ‚úì
2. Can validate at compile time ‚úì
3. Can generate AST types ‚úì
4. Code integrates with Rust ‚úì

**Defers:**
- Theory composition
- Rewrite rules
- Parameterization
- Parser generation

---

## Decision Points

### After POC (End of Week 1)
**Question:** Are procedural macros viable?

**Evaluate:**
- Implementation complexity acceptable?
- Error messages clear?
- Generated code idiomatic?
- Team comfortable with approach?

**Options:**
- ‚úÖ **Proceed with hybrid** (runtime + macros)
- üîÑ **Pure runtime only** (skip macros)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Delay decision** (more research)

### After Runtime Implementation (End of Month 1)
**Question:** Does runtime path meet needs?

**Evaluate:**
- Performance acceptable?
- Network integration working?
- Validation comprehensive?

**Options:**
- ‚úÖ **Sufficient** (stop here)
- üîÑ **Need macros** (continue to Phase 4)

---

## Resources Required

### Time Investment

| Phase | Duration | Who |
|-------|----------|-----|
| POC (macros) | 11-14 hours | 1 developer |
| Runtime implementation | 4 weeks | 1-2 developers |
| Network integration | 2 weeks | 1 developer |
| Macro full features | 2-3 months | 1-2 developers |

### Skills Needed
- ‚úÖ Rust fundamentals (have)
- ‚úÖ Parser/compiler basics (have)
- üî∂ Procedural macros (can learn)
- üî∂ Theory composition (domain knowledge needed)

### Dependencies
```toml
# New (for macros):
proc-macro2 = "1.0"
quote = "1.0"
syn = "2.0"

# New (for runtime):
lalrpop = "0.20"  # or pest for PEG

# Optional (for optimization):
egg = "0.9"       # e-graphs
cranelift = "0.100"  # JIT
```

## Risks & Mitigations

### High Risk: Macros Too Complex
**Impact:** Wasted effort, delays  
**Probability:** Medium  
**Mitigation:** POC validates early (11 hours invested)

### Medium Risk: Performance Issues
**Impact:** Runtime path slower than Scala  
**Probability:** Low  
**Mitigation:** Profiling, optimization, optional JIT

### Low Risk: Team Unfamiliarity
**Impact:** Slower development  
**Probability:** Medium  
**Mitigation:** Documentation, training, gradual adoption

## Success Metrics

### POC Success (Week 1)
- [ ] `theory! {}` macro compiles
- [ ] Generates valid AST enums
- [ ] Compile error for invalid category
- [ ] Example runs successfully

### Runtime Success (Month 1)
- [ ] Parses `Rholang.module`
- [ ] Passes all Scala test cases
- [ ] Integrates with rholang/ codebase
- [ ] Performance ‚â• Scala implementation

### Network Success (Month 2)

---

## Integration Impact

### On rholang/ Crate
**Current:**
```rust
use rholang_parser; // External crate
```

**Future:**
```rust
theory! { Rholang }  // Generated in-crate
// OR
let rholang = mettail::load_theory("Rholang.module")?;
```

### On f1r3fly Network
**New Capability:**
```rust
// Send language definitions over network
let theory_bytes = serialize(&rholang_theory);
network.send(theory_bytes)?;

// Receive and execute
let received = deserialize::<Theory>(&bytes)?;
let ast = received.parse(program)?;
received.interpret(&mut space, ast);
```
