# Equation Implementation - Revised Approach

**Date**: November 19, 2025 (After Review)

---

## TL;DR

**Problem**: Even `{P, PZero} == P` fails because `PZero` is a constructor, not a simple variable.

**Solution**: **Reuse rewrite rule pattern matching!** Use `generate_ascent_pattern` from `rewrite_gen.rs` via adapter pattern.

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Handles ALL expression types (already proven)
- ✅ Rest patterns work automatically (already implemented)
- ✅ Lower risk (reusing code, not reinventing)
- ✅ Simpler implementation (adapter ~50 lines)
- ✅ Future-proof (improvements benefit both)

## Key Insights from Review

### 1. Why Auto-Flip Didn't Work

You already flipped `P == {P, 0}` to `{P, 0} == P`, but it still failed because:
```rust
elements = [Var(P), Var(PZero)]
// elem 0: Var(P) - passes (!is_constructor)
// elem 1: Var(PZero) - FAILS (is_constructor returns true!)
```

The problem wasn't the bare variable - it was that **only simple variables** (not constructors) are supported in collection patterns.

### 2. Equations ARE Like Rewrites

Exactly! Both:
- Match patterns on LHS
- Construct terms on RHS
- Handle all expression types
- Support nested patterns
- Need binder handling

**Rewrite rules already solved this problem!**

### 3. Rest Patterns Come Free

Since we're reusing `generate_ascent_pattern`, rest pattern support is automatic. The rewrite logic already extracts rest bags correctly.

## The Adapter Approach

**Core Idea**: Equations call the same pattern matching logic as rewrites, with a thin adapter.

```rust
fn generate_equation_pattern_via_rewrite_logic(
    expr: &Expr,
    term_name: &str,
    bindings: &mut HashMap<String, Ident>,
    theory: &TheoryDef,
) -> Option<Vec<TokenStream>> {
    // 1. Setup adapter data structures
    let mut rewrite_bindings = HashMap::new();
    let mut clauses = Vec::new();
    // ... (empty duplicate_vars, equational_checks for equations)

    // 2. Call proven rewrite logic
    generate_ascent_pattern(
        expr, &term_ident, &expected_category, theory,
        &mut rewrite_bindings, ..., &mut clauses, ...
    );

    // 3. Convert bindings format
    for (var_name, _) in rewrite_bindings {
        bindings.insert(var_name, format_ident!("..."));
    }

    Some(clauses)
}
```

**That's it!** ~50 lines of adapter code.

## What Changes

**mettail-macros/src/ascent_gen.rs**:
1. Add `use crate::rewrite_gen::generate_ascent_pattern;`
2. Add adapter function (~50 lines)
3. Replace `generate_equation_pattern` call with adapter
4. Remove old `generate_equation_pattern` (~200 lines deleted)

**Everything else**: No changes needed!

---

## What Stays the Same

- ✅ Rewrite rule logic untouched
- ✅ RHS construction untouched
- ✅ Freshness generation untouched
- ✅ All existing tests still pass

**Risk**: Minimal - isolated to equation generation only

---

## Timeline

**Original Plan**: 2 weeks of complex pattern matching reimplementation
**Revised Plan**: 2 weeks, but mostly testing! Implementation is simpler.

- **Week 1, Days 1-3**: Adapter (~1 day actual coding)
- **Week 1, Days 4-5**: RHS verification (should just work)
- **Week 2, Days 1-2**: Freshness (verify existing code)
- **Week 2, Days 3-5**: Comprehensive testing

---

## Why This is Better

1. **Proven Code**: `generate_ascent_pattern` handles 100% of cases in production
2. **No Duplication**: Single source of truth for pattern matching
3. **Free Features**: Rest patterns, nested patterns, binders all work
4. **Lower Risk**: Reusing > Reimplementing
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Fix pattern matching once, benefits both
6. **Future-Proof**: New expression types work automatically

---

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve revised plan
2. Implement adapter (~1 day)
3. Test all 6 equations generate correctly
4. Add comprehensive equation tests
5. Verify semantic correctness

**Bottom Line**: Same goal, simpler path. Reuse the wheel, don't reinvent it!
