# Phase 1 to Phase 2 Transition

**Date:** After substitution fix completion  
**Status:** Phase 1 ✅ COMPLETE | Phase 2 🎯 READY TO START

---

## ✅ Phase 1 Achievements

### What We Built
1. **Macro Framework** - `theory! {}` macro with full parsing
2. **Type System** - Sound category inference and validation
3. **Binders** - Correct via `moniker` with locally-nameless repr
4. **Substitution** - Cross-category with full field recursion ✅
5. **Rewrite Syntax** - Parsing and validation (not execution)
6. **Test Suite** - Rho Calculus working end-to-end

### Final Bug Fix
**Problem:** Substitution didn't recurse into all fields.
- `PPar` was cloning instead of recursing
- `POutput` body wasn't being substituted
- `PInput` channel wasn't being substituted

**Solution:** Generate substitution that always recurses into category fields, choosing the correct `substitute_X` method based on replacement type.

**Result:** All 3 Rho Calculus tests passing! ✅

## 🎯 Phase 2 Overview

**Goal:** Make theories executable - parse, match, rewrite, reduce.

**Duration:** 3-4 months (10 weeks)

**Deliverable:** CLI tool that can run Rho Calculus programs.

---

## 📅 Phase 2 Timeline

### Weeks 1-2: Parser Generation (LALRPOP)
**Goal:** Replace broken parser combinator approach.

**Tasks:**
1. Add LALRPOP to build system
2. Generate `.lalrpop` grammar files from theory definitions
3. Handle operator precedence and associativity
4. Integrate with existing AST types
5. Test with Rho Calculus examples

**Success:** `RhoCalc::parse("0 | *@0")` returns correct AST.

### Weeks 3-4: Pattern Matching
**Goal:** Match rewrite LHS patterns against AST terms.

**Tasks:**
1. Design pattern representation (variables, constructors, wildcards)
2. Implement matching algorithm with backtracking
3. Handle binders (α-equivalence)
4. Check freshness conditions
5. Return variable bindings

**Success:** Find where communication rule applies in a term.

### Weeks 5-6: Rewrite Application
**Goal:** Transform terms using matched rewrites.

**Tasks:**
1. Apply variable bindings to RHS
2. Execute substitutions from `(subst P x Q)`
3. Handle multiple matches (strategy TBD)
4. Verify result type-correctness
5. Benchmark performance

**Success:** `for(ch x){*x} | ch!(0)` → `*@0`

### Weeks 7-8: Reduction Engine
**Goal:** Multi-step reduction to normal form.

**Tasks:**
1. Implement reduction strategies (innermost, outermost, etc.)
2. Add termination checking (step limits, cycle detection)
3. Support trace/debug output
4. Handle non-determinism (for exploration)
5. Optimize hot paths

**Success:** Complex programs reduce correctly and efficiently.

### Weeks 9-10: CLI Interpreter
**Goal:** End-to-end usable tool.

**Tasks:**
1. Command-line argument parsing
2. Load theory from file
3. Parse input term
4. Reduce to normal form
5. Pretty-print result
6. Add verbose/debug modes

**Success:** `mettail run rhocalc.theory "program"` works!

## 🔬 Key Design Decisions for Phase 2

### 1. Parser: LALRPOP vs Alternatives
**Decision:** LALRPOP
- **Pros:** Rust-native, good error messages, LR(1)
- **Cons:** Learning curve, build-time generation
- **Alternatives:** Nom (too low-level), Pest (PEG issues), hand-written (too much work)

### 2. Pattern Matching: Algorithm Choice
**Options:**
- **Backtracking** - Simple, correct, potentially slow
- **Compilation** - Fast, complex implementation
- **Trie-based** - Medium speed, moderate complexity

**Likely Choice:** Start with backtracking, optimize later if needed.

### 3. Reduction Strategy: Which to Implement First?
**Options:**
- **Innermost** - Apply to subterms first (most predictable)
- **Outermost** - Apply to whole term first (sometimes faster)
- **Leftmost** - Textual order (simplest)
- **All** - Explore all reduction paths (expensive)

**Plan:** Implement innermost first, add others as configurable.

### 4. Congruence Rules: Manual or Auto?
**Question:** Given `s => t`, auto-generate `P|s => P|t`?

**Phase 2 Decision:** Manual - user writes all rules explicitly.
**Phase 4 Decision:** Auto-generate (with design work).

### 5. Equation Handling: Now or Later?
**Question:** How do equations `==` interact with rewrites `=>`?

**Phase 2 Decision:** Ignore equations (just rewrites).
**Phase 4 Decision:** E-graph integration for equation saturation.

## ⚠️ Known Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: LALRPOP Learning Curve
**Mitigation:** Start with simple grammar, iterate.

### Risk 2: Pattern Matching Performance
**Mitigation:** Profile early, optimize hot paths, consider compilation.

### Risk 3: Non-Termination
**Mitigation:** Step limits, timeouts, cycle detection.

### Risk 4: Complex Rewrite Interactions
**Mitigation:** Extensive testing, clear strategy documentation.

### Risk 5: Scope Creep
**Mitigation:** Stick to plan, defer features to later phases.
